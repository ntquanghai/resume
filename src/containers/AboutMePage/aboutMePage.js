                    Hi, I am Hai. I am a student at the University of Science and Technology in Hanoi. My journey in the world of
                    programming and specifically web development started on August 2021, and I have been a dedicated follower of the subject
                    ever since. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    During the period, I have had the opportunity to not only learn about the basic skillset of a developer, but also 
                    work with people on various projects. Through such expriences, I realize that to reach my goal of becoming a succesful web developer,
                    I would need to learn from the best, which is why I am seeking for an internship. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Although I can not promise great contributions to the company, I can confidently claim that I am an reliable, responsible and adept individual
                    who is ready to learn from their mistakes, and improve upon it.
